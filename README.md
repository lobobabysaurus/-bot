# Filbot
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/lobobabysaurus/Filbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/lobobabysaurus/Filbot)

Purpose: to create a Russian-themed bot, with a particular love
for all things Soviet Union, that bothers the human owners
in a dynasty hockey league by knowing a bunch of Russian insults,
some things about hockey, and how to make absurd trade proposals.

Inspiration: Boris Yeltsin and Ilya Brizgalov quotes
